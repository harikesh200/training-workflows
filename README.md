# Machine Maintenance Workflow API

Job-based machine-maintenance automation built with Bun, TypeScript, and
Express. The service converts the workflow from
`Agentic_Manufacturing_singlebtn.ipynb` into an asynchronous HTTP API that:

1. analyzes machine-log errors against a PDF maintenance manual;
2. matches recommended replacement parts to a vendor catalog;
3. creates one purchase-order CSV per matched vendor;
4. sends purchase orders through Gmail SMTP;
5. generates a plant-level summary with OpenAI; and
6. emails the final text report to the plant head.

Workflow state is persisted locally as JSON, and generated reports remain
available through artifact download endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3.14 or later
- An OpenAI API key
- Gmail SMTP sender credentials for email delivery

The API can be used directly or with the companion React operations console.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and create the local environment file:

```powershell
bun install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`, then start the development server:

```powershell
bun run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

| URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `http://localhost:3000/health` | Liveness check |
| `http://localhost:3000/ready` | Readiness check |
| `http://localhost:3000/v1/workflows` | Workflow API |

The root URL intentionally returns `404`; this project exposes an API rather
than a web page.

### Optional Frontend

If `Training Workflows Frontend` is checked out beside this repository, start
it in a second terminal:

```powershell
Set-Location "..\Training Workflows Frontend"
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The frontend uses
`http://localhost:3000` by default; set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in its
`.env.local` file to target a different API.

## Environment

Configuration is loaded from `.env` and validated when the process starts.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | — | API key used to generate the text summary |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | No | `gpt-4o` | OpenAI model passed to the Responses API |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | HTTP server port |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `development` | `development`, `test`, or `production` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Pino log level |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | No | `http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000` | Comma-separated allowed origins, or `*` |

SMTP credentials are supplied with each workflow request. The password is
held only for the running workflow and is not written to job storage.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Start the API in watch mode |
| `bun run start` | Start through `src/bootstrap.ts`, including AWS Lambda temporary-directory setup |
| `bun run typecheck` | Run strict TypeScript checks |
| `bun run test` | Run the Bun test suite; succeeds when no tests exist |
| `bun run build` | Bundle the API to `dist/server.js` |
| `bun dist/server.js` | Run the generated bundle |

## Workflow Inputs

`POST /v1/workflows` accepts `multipart/form-data`. Each uploaded file is
limited to 10 MiB.

| Field | Type | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `machineLogs` | File | CSV with `timestamp`, `machine_id`, `machine_name`, and `error_code` |
| `errorManual` | File | PDF containing the error-manual format described below |
| `vendorCatalog` | File | CSV with `part_name`, `vendor`, `delivery_time`, and numeric `price` |
| `senderEmail` | Text | Gmail SMTP sender address |
| `senderPassword` | Text | SMTP password or app password |
| `vendorEmails` | Text | JSON array of valid email addresses |
| `plantHeadEmail` | Text | Final report recipient |

CSV headers are trimmed and matched case-insensitively. Extra columns are
ignored.

### Machine Logs

```csv
timestamp,machine_id,machine_name,error_code
10-02-2025 07:22,PLT1-Z3-FEEDER-30,Feed Mechanism,E108
10-02-2025 09:51,PLT1-Z3-PRESS-44,Hydraulic Press,None
```

Rows with an empty error code or `None` are skipped.

### Error Manual

The PDF text must contain blocks in this format:

```text
Error Code: E108
1) Error Description: ...
2) Possible Causes: a) ... b) ...
3) Recommended Part Replacement: a) ... b) ...
4) Severity: High
```

Error codes must use the `E` followed by digits format. Recommended part names
are matched case-sensitively to the vendor catalog after whitespace and hyphen
normalization.

### Vendor Catalog

```csv
part_name,vendor,delivery_time,price
Feeder Motor Coupling 12B,VendorA,2 days,4333
Feeder Motor Coupling 12B,VendorB,3 days,4199
```

Generated invoice vendors are sorted alphabetically. `vendorEmails` is mapped
to that sorted list by position, so the first email belongs to the first
vendor, the second email to the second vendor, and so on. Missing addresses
produce a `no_email_configured` status; extra addresses are unused.

## API

Successful JSON responses use a `{ "data": ... }` envelope. Errors use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

### Create a Workflow

```http
POST /v1/workflows
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/workflows \
  -F "machineLogs=@machine_logs.csv" \
  -F "errorManual=@error_manual.pdf" \
  -F "vendorCatalog=@vendor_catalog.csv" \
  -F "senderEmail=sender@gmail.com" \
  -F "senderPassword=app-password" \
  -F 'vendorEmails=["vendor-a@example.com","vendor-b@example.com"]' \
  -F "plantHeadEmail=plant-head@example.com"
```

The API returns `202 Accepted` after persisting the queued job:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "wf_8b9f8c4a-...",
    "status": "queued",
    "currentStep": "queued",
    "progress": 0
  }
}
```

### Get Workflow Status

```http
GET /v1/workflows/:id
```

The response contains status, progress, vendor-email mappings, artifact
metadata, timestamps, and any terminal error:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "wf_8b9f8c4a-...",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "currentStep": "completed",
    "progress": 100,
    "senderEmail": "sender@gmail.com",
    "vendorEmailList": ["vendor-a@example.com"],
    "resolvedVendorEmails": {
      "VendorA": "vendor-a@example.com"
    },
    "plantHeadEmail": "plant-head@example.com",
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "name": "agent1-output",
        "contentType": "text/csv"
      }
    ],
    "error": null,
    "createdAt": "2026-06-29T10:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-29T10:00:05.000Z",
    "completedAt": "2026-06-29T10:00:05.000Z"
  }
}
```

Workflow statuses are `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, and `failed`.
Running jobs progress through:

1. `uploads_saved`
2. `log_analysis`
3. `purchase_orders`
4. `vendor_emails`
5. `summary_report`
6. `plant_head_email`

Vendor email failures are recorded in the summary but do not stop the
workflow. A failed OpenAI summary or plant-head email marks the job as
`failed`.

### Download an Artifact

```http
GET /v1/workflows/:id/artifacts/:name
```

Artifact names are returned by the status endpoint:

| Name | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `agent1-output` | Analyzed maintenance findings CSV |
| `invoice-<vendor>` | Aggregated purchase-order CSV for one vendor |
| `tabular-summary` | Full workflow summary CSV |
| `text-summary` | OpenAI-generated leadership report |

The text report is written as a plant-head executive brief with an overview,
maintenance assessment, procurement and delivery position, management
actions, and conclusion. Email outcomes are counted once per purchase-order
vendor rather than once per duplicated summary row.

Vendor segments in artifact names are sanitized to letters, numbers,
underscores, and hyphens.

## Local Storage

Runtime data is created under `data/`:

```text
data/
├── uploads/<workflow-id>/      # Saved workflow inputs
├── artifacts/<workflow-id>/    # Generated CSV and text files
└── jobs/<workflow-id>.json     # Persisted job state
```

These paths are excluded from Git. Job records contain email addresses and
local file paths, but not SMTP passwords.

This repository uses an in-process workflow runner and local filesystem
storage. It does not resume interrupted jobs after a process restart and is
not suitable for horizontally scaled deployment without replacing those
components with shared durable infrastructure.

`src/app.ts` composes the Express application, `src/server.ts` creates
dependencies and starts the listener, and `src/bootstrap.ts` configures
temporary paths before loading the server in AWS Lambda environments.
